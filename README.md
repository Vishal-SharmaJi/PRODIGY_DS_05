1. We start by importing the necessary libraries, including pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for data visualization.
2. We load the dataset from the provided URL using pd.read_csv() function from pandas.
3. We then analyze road conditions by counting the occurrences of each road condition in the dataset and printing the results.
4. Next, we analyze weather conditions in a similar manner by counting the occurrences of each weather condition.
5. We proceed to analyze the time of day by counting the occurrences of accidents during different times of the day.
6. Finally, we visualize accident hotspots on a scatter plot using longitude and latitude coordinates. The severity of accidents is represented by color intensity on the plot.
By running this code, we can gain insights into patterns related to road conditions, weather, time of day, and visualize accident hotspots based on the provided dataset.
